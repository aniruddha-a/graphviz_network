How to create a network diagram with Graphviz
=============================================

Look through the history of the repository to see the steps that I used to create the network diagram.
Each step has the code and the resultant image that was created.

Once graphviz was installed correctly, I used the command:
    dot.exe -Tpng graph.graphviz -o graph.png
to create the images.
